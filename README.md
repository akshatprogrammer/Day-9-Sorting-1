# What is Sorting?
      Sorting is use to arrange data in ascending or decreasing order.
   * Internal Sorting -> Takes place in main memory. </br> There is no need for external memory for execution of this type of sorting.</br>
   Example -> Bubble,Selection,Insertion etc. <.br>
   
   * External Sorting -> Outside main memory.</br> While sorting the huge data, it is fetched in segment from disk to main memory.</br>
   Example - > Merge , Quick </br>
                                   
## Bubble Sort
We take first two elements and form a pair then compare elements in pair, smaller one is placed at first position and larger element become second. </br>
This process is repeated in such pass.
</br> Time Complexity - > O(n^2)
</br> It takes (n-1) iterations to sort N elements.</br>

## Selection Sort
In place comparison based algorithm.</br>
Not suited for large data sets.</br>
We take a **min** element and compare it with others.</br>
Time complexity - > O(n^2)</br>
It takes N-1 iterations to sort array of N elements.</br>

## Insertion Sort
The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part.</br>
Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.</br>
**Algorithm**</br>
To sort an array of size n in ascending order:</br>
1: Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array.</br>
2: Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor.</br>
3: If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.</br>
